# WebProject
Creating Web in 180 Days<br>
Inspired By `Jennifer Dewalt`!<br>
Here's the Website of her Project https://jenniferdewalt.com/<br>
Using some front end tools to build the website in order to practice the skills. <br>
Website will be using AJAX, JSON, JQuery, ES6 all these kinds of latest skills.<br>
Later on I will practice more on React, and then using NodeJS to create more back-end stuffs(Includes MongoDB).
